# ArgentBank

This project is the 13th project of the "Javascript - React Application Developer" student path at OpenClassrooms. It is a React project that serves as the frontend application for a banking application. The project includes a homepage, a sign-in page, and a user page ("/user") that displays user information and a transaction list. The main objective of this project was to implement a global state using Redux and to interact with an API.

Please note that this project requires a backend and API, which are available at [https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Project-10-Bank-API).
